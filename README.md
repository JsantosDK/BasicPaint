# BasicPaint
A basic version of Paint.

This version requires a Mouse and Keyboard.
The User can click on a colour of the palette and it will be saved for use when colouring the cells of the grid.
The erasor is activated when clicking outside of the grid and the colour palette. For full clear the key C can be used.

The grid will be saved when pressing the key O, and loaded when pressing the key P.
The Simple GFX library does not support unprecise mouse clicks. 
This means that a click that is done when the Mouse is not perfectly stil (any small movement)l is not considered .
